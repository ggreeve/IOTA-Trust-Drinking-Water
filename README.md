## Personal Introduction
I am a Controls Engineer that designs, configures and integrates industrial control systems to include PLC's amd SCADA systems. I have been following the IOTA Foundations Tangle project for a few years now and find the technology facinating. I was immidealy attracted to this project since it requires no fees to interacting with their Distributed Ledger Technology called the Tangle, there are so many usecases that require micropayments and DLT, IOTA makes this possible. 

## Goal
I am not a coder, but I have been able to sucessfully run some home automation and small IoT projects on [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/).
This hackathon gave me the motivation to attemp my first IOTA project. I always had a usecase in mind that I wanted to implement using IOTA. 
With the release of IoT2Tangle's [Streams-http-gateway](https://github.com/iot2tangle/Streams-http-gateway) allowing for simple http interaction between Node-Red and the IOTA Tangle using {IOTA STREAMS} (https://www.iota.org/solutions/streams), this goal was within reach.
I am now able to show that a noncoder / tinkerer like me can do some pretty cool stuff with a Raspberry Pi, Node-Red and the IOTA Tangle

## Showcase

## Software requirements

* [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/) xxxxxxx
* [Streams-http-gateway](https://github.com/iot2tangle/Streams-http-gateway) Rust based Streams implementation to send messages to the Tangle.
* [Keepy](https://github.com/iot2tangle/Keepy) A Nodejs Streams Gateway Keeper.

## Bill of materials

* Raspberry Pi, I used a RPi 3B+
